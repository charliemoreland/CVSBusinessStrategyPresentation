CVS Business Strategy Presentation 
An individual presentation I created for my Innovative Business Strategy course. The focus of this presentation was Corporate Level Strategy Tactics. 
With digital transformation threatening the traditional Direct-to-Consumer model in the pharmacy sector, it’s clear that adaptation is crucial. In my strategic plan, I highlight CVS’s current position in the pharmaceutical supply chain through horizontal integration as a key competitive advantage, and outline strategies to leverage this advantage moving forward.
